# These questions are for meeting 14/11 with DF

- PCA not working due to the variance being too low. What are your suggestions to fix this?
- Too may observations for PCA?
- Best use of weights?
-  After cleaning, tidying and removing missing datapoints, it was found that there were only around 1000 complete samples 
out of the 100,000+. Therefore, there is a risk that these 1000 datapoints might not be truly representative, how would you
solve an issue like this? (it is certain columns)
- Do graphics have to be static on our final pdf or can they move if things are hovered over them (will it be opened in adobe acrobat)?
- Structure to final report: how to include exploratory data analysis
- Average hours per day, VS Average hours per day for who engaged in the activity, VS Average percent per day for who engaged
- To begin looking at fewer variables/relationships, what sort of justification do you need?


# These questions below are for meeting 21/11 with ET

- Having identified areas of interest, how deep does our analysis of these areas need to go? What should be included?
