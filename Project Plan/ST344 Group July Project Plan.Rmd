#Methodology

The nature of this project means that exploratory data analysis is vital. Therefore, at the planning stage we cannot know exactly how and what we will be analysing in the dataset. For this reason we will be following a variation of the agile project management methodoogy. This will alow us to be flexible in our approach, performing exploratory analysis in stages to ensure we are able to provide the most rigourous and intersting conclusions.
