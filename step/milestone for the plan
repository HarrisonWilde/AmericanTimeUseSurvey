step 1 
to decide the target variables would be used and the topic would be focused on in the report 
(Note:)
(simple analysis and graphs before the 2nd Meeting)
(Combine all ideas together in the 2nd or 3rd meeting, because of the feasibility)
(In order to minimize the risk, need plan B of the combination of variables.)

step 2 
use PCA and other techniques to check the feasibility.
(Note:)
(share works in Messenger group or Github to discuss)
(!!!before drawing a final agreement,Â might do step 1 again)

step 3 
well-explained the analysis and provide the conclusions
(Note:)
(need to improve the graphs)
(while explaining, might need to quote some materials) (maybe some from the readings recommended in the moodle page? Could make it easier)

step 4 
proof-reading

step 5 
slides

step 6 
speech draft and practicing
