# Introduction

The aim of this report is to discover how Americans' time-use patterns have changed over the last 15 years or so. The datasets ([1](https://www.bls.gov/tus/special.requests/atussum_0317.zip) & [2](https://www.bls.gov/tus/special.requests/atusresp_0317.zip)) used to try and tackle this are results of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) [@ATUS]. ATUS respondents are interviewed only one time about how they spent their time on the previous day, where they were, and whom they were with. The survey records the time spent on 431 different activities which are grouped into 17 different categories. In the analysis these categories will often be refered to by variable beginning with **tu** followed by a two-digit **category number**. The meaning of each category number can be found on the [ATUS website](https://www.bls.gov/tus/lexiconnoex0317.pdf).

The [Bureau of Labor Statistics website](https://www.bls.gov/tus/charts.htm) provides a number of simple charts, looking at the 2017 annual average for these categories. This report provides a more definitive conclusion on how time-use patterns changed over the period, evidenced with statistical investigation of the data. The findings explain in depth where some of the biggest fluctuations are and briefly note possible reasons for this. Limitations to the analysis are noted when appropriate and these must be taken into account when performing any further analysis or summaries; mentioned with any conclusions.   

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Fill in.

Talk about how we plotted for Train and Validate data for all of the models. Split data roughly in half to look at every other month, isolating our assigned month into the validation set. Then we will plot full models in next section.

# Dan's Stuff



# Gender Roles

Intro stuff, describe 
Chris and Harry doing in separate doc for now.

It was decided to model and plot male and female time spent independently as this is more intuitive and accessible to a reader than just the difference. Justification of not just plotting difference.

## Housework

Do the four

## Childcare



## Food Preparation



## Working Hours



## House Maintenance

Quote a low participation rate, but could have potentially remained unchanged / more balanced to begin with?? Depends on if it is or not.

## Vehicle Maintenance

Similar to above, potentially unchanged or uninteresting.

# Limitations of the Data

15 years is a short period.
